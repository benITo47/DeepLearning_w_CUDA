# DeepLearning_w_CUDA


This repository contains lab exercises from an introductory class on machine learning and deep learning using CUDA, which I completed during my 4th semester. The course covered a wide range of foundational topics in machine learning and deep learning, with a particular emphasis on leveraging CUDA for accelerated computation.

## Topics Covered

- **Classification and Regression**
  - Types of problems that can be solved with machine learning
  - Key differences and applications

- **Simple Classification Networks**
  - Importance of loss functions
  - Activation functions
  - Parameters like batch size, batch normalization, and optimizers

- **Introduction to Convolutional Networks (CNNs)**
  - Basics of convolutional layers
  - Pooling layers
  - Application of CNNs in image processing

- **Introduction to Residual Networks (ResNets)**
  - Concept of residual learning
  - Architecture of ResNets
  - Advantages of using ResNets for deep learning tasks

- **Introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
  - Architecture of GANs
  - Inner workings of the generator and discriminator
  - Applications of GANs in generating realistic data
